# Fortran Codes

In this directory, the fortran codes that underly the fluctuation calculation may be found.

There are four codes in this section:

The first is msd\_rot\_calc.f90 which calculates the mean-squared displacement and reorientation of water.

The second is multi-atom\_msd\_rot\_calc.f90 which is the more generalized version that applies to other molecules.

The third is visc\_calc.f90 which calculates the shear viscosity.

The fourth is flux\_side.f90 which calculates the ion pairing flux side correlation function
